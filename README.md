# event-emitter-cli-little-experiment
A little experiment to learn how to extend Events into a new class

## How to play the game
1. Clone this repo

2. Open a terminal where the **app.js** file is located

3. Run **```node gambling.js [player1] [kind/asshole] [player2] [kind/asshole] [player3] [kind/asshole]```**
were **[player]** is just a name and **[kind]** or **[asshole]** is an argument wich the game will use in its algorithm.

4. Other alternative is typing **```npm link```** and then just **```gambling [player1] [kind/asshole] [player2] [kind/asshole] [player3] [kind/asshole]```**

5. Have fun

## What is all about
This repo is just an excuse to learn how to extend 'events' over a new class, and play a little with the ***global object*** of NodeJS
